# Personal website

This is a personal website built using the vCard format. It serves as a digital business card, showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information.

This is a fork from the repo [Sadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) which it was inspired to. Give a star to their repo.
